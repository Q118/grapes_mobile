/*
okay.. link on one,, one of the grapes to just that grape day
then the user goes through the editig
form ttheir u can share or edit etc...
but this way the home page is for viewing whihc  is good for it to be a vuisual reminder for peeple throughout the day and to use for a widget in furture
and the Grape page is for editing and sharing
only can edit the current day
if an older one, you can still share a letter
and the global feed is still of all the letters shared from all the users
* screens with links: share, edit, grape id
    ?  grape_id -> share | edit + grape id as params

    ? home -> grape_id + grape id as params

* tabs -> top 3 Home, Global, Settings+
