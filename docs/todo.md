- a customizavle widget for their homescreen that displays their current days agenda or displays urge to go mke ojne for today if they havent yet

- use this for auth:
https://github.com/codingki/react-native-expo-template/tree/master/template-typescript-bottom-tabs-supabase-auth-flow
- perhaps starting with this template is a good idea

- once frontend is mostly initially done then use supabase like bring it in.
