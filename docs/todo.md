<!-- * ive begun setting up the context but not quite in use -->

* its really hot user friendlyto have so many inputs on one page ;liek event ho i got got it and have it avoiding the keuyboard thing it sis not a good experience and it be better to have edit button trigger taking to the letter

<!-- TODO: go back in to grapes superbase and chage back the auth config that requiresd new users to confirm their email address before first login...

<!-- TODO to set up the subscribing to new posts... use https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/subscribe -->

- timeZone should be set in settings per user? ...option to be and by default use the device time zone
[expo]https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/date-time-picker/

// const currentTimeStampInMilliseconds = (new Date()).getTime();

- a customizavle widget for their homescreen that displays their current days agenda or displays urge to go mke ojne for today if they havent yet


- show option in the filling out form for a user to view suggestions from teh global feed

- use this for auth:
https://github.com/codingki/react-native-expo-template/tree/master/template-typescript-bottom-tabs-supabase-auth-flow
- perhaps starting with this template is a good idea

- once frontend is mostly initially done then use supabase like bring it in.
