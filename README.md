## What is GRAPES©?
GRAPES© is a daily practice. Each day, choose a simple activity from each of the different categories. GRAPES is great for anyone, but particularly can help with those who experience anxiety and depression. It can help you to feel more balanced and improve your mood. 

GRAPES© is a tool from [Dialectical Behaviour Therapy](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22838-dialectical-behavior-therapy-dbt#:~:text=Dialectical%20behavior%20therapy%20(DBT)%20is,mental%20health%20conditions%20as%20well.) (DBT); an evidence-based psychotherapy created by [Marsha M. Linehan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_M._Linehan) and branches from [Cognitive Behaviour Therapy](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral) (CBT).

## What is this App?
This app is a mobile version of the GRAPES© practice. It is a tool to help you to practice GRAPES© daily. It is also a tool to help you to track your progress and see your growth over time. You keep track every day of your planned activities. You can share the activities you have done with others. You can also see what others have done and get ideas for your own GRAPES© practice in the Global Feed.
